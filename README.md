# Template-Base-AcademicDocco

This repository provides a powerful and flexible template for creating academic papers using R Markdown and LaTeX. It is designed to be used in conjunction with a Large Language Model (LLM) like Gemini to automate the process of turning research notes into a fully formatted, publication-ready document.

## Features

- Based on R Markdown for easy content creation.
- Utilizes LaTeX for high-quality typesetting and formatting.
- Includes a pre-configured bibliography setup with BibTeX.
- Designed for an automated workflow where an LLM populates the template from a simple text file.

## Workflow

The intended workflow for this template is to be used with an AI assistant. For detailed instructions on this process, please refer to the `GEMINI.md` file.

The basic steps are:

1.  **Create an `input.txt` file**: This file will contain your personal information, paper metadata, core content/notes, and references. A recommended structure is provided in `GEMINI.md`.
2.  **Instruct your LLM assistant**: Ask the LLM to process your `input.txt` file. The LLM will then:
    - Update the bibliography (`Bibliografia.bib`).
    - Populate the metadata and content of the main R Markdown file (`TemplateDocco-0.Rmd`).
    - Structure and enhance your notes into a coherent academic paper.
3.  **Compile the PDF**: The LLM will compile the document to produce the final PDF.

## Getting Started

To use this template manually or to compile the final document, you will need the following installed:

- R and RStudio
- A LaTeX distribution (e.g., MiKTeX, TeX Live)
- The R package `rmarkdown`
